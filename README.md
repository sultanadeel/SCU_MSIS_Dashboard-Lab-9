# Project Statement

In this redesign assignment, we aspire to create more pursuasive and easy to understand visualizations for the metrics developed for prospective SCU MSIS students. The main idea that we are incorporating in this redesign assignment is to integrate some of the important metrics for the intended audience to compare and contrast different measures while choosing Santa Clara University over other California Schools

# Goals

The goal is to provide the audience a privilege to easily compare and contrast the MSIS programs provided by a group of universities in 
California. Another goal as a designer of visualizations on behalf of Santa Clara University is to use valid and supportive arguments to
make SCU stand out against other universities in the region using various factors.

# Question

Audience is interested in fing out which program is suitable for their specific objectives. Which graduate school best meet their requirements and characteristics to pursue MSIS degree

# Metrics of the SCU MSIS program:

Prospective students evaluate number of different alternatives and options while considering and applying for a graduate degree admission. The most important metrics for choosing MSIS graduate program are: tuition fees, ranking, acceptance rate, student-faculty ratio and post-graduation employment opportunities especially for the international students who want to realize their American dream and aspire to get hired by a leading tech firm in Silicon Valley. Five of the metrics to be used in our data visualization and corresponding claims are as follows:

## 1. Ranking
## 2. Acceptance Rates
## 3.	Student-faculty Ratio
## 4.	Tuition Fees
## 5.	Employment Opportunities after graduation

# Assumptions:

For integrating the metrics and making it easier for student audience to compare and contrast, we selected a group of universities as follows:

## 1. San Jose State University
## 2. California Polytechnic University
## 3.	California State University - Long Beach
## 4.	California State University - Chico
## 5.	Santa Clara University
