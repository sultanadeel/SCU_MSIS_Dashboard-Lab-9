# Project Statement

In this redesign assignment, we aspire to create more pursuasive and easy to understand visualizations for the metrics developed for prospective SCU MSIS students. The main idea that we are incorporating in this redesign assignment is to integrate some of the important metrics for the intended audience to compare and contrast different measures while choosing Santa Clara University over other California Schools

# Arguments Model (Claim):

Our main claim in this redesign project is to pursuade a prospective MSIS student that Santa Clara University is a good program for him/her and despite being little expensive, the program offers great opportunities to pursue a successful career in Silicon Valley, California

# Goals

The goal is to provide the audience a privilege to easily compare and contrast the MSIS programs provided by a group of universities in 
California. Another goal as a designer of visualizations on behalf of Santa Clara University is to use valid and supportive arguments to
make SCU stand out against other universities in the region using various factors.

# Questions

Audience is interested in fing out which program is suitable for their specific objectives. Which graduate school best meet their requirements and characteristics to pursue MSIS degree

# Metrics of the SCU MSIS program:

Prospective students evaluate number of different alternatives and options while considering and applying for a graduate degree admission. The most important metrics for choosing MSIS graduate program are: tuition fees, ranking, acceptance rate, student-faculty ratio and post-graduation employment opportunities especially for the international students who want to realize their American dream and aspire to get hired by a leading tech firm in Silicon Valley. Five of the metrics to be used in our data visualization and corresponding claims are as follows:

## 1. Ranking
## 2. Acceptance Rates
## 3.	Student-faculty Ratio
## 4.	Tuition Fees
## 5.	Employment Opportunities after graduation

# Assumptions:

For integrating the metrics and making it easier for student audience to compare and contrast, we selected a group of universities as follows:

## 1. San Jose State University
## 2. California Polytechnic University
## 3.	California State University - Long Beach
## 4.	California State University - Chico
## 5.	Santa Clara University

# Claim   

Santa Clara University is a top ranked school with a resonably higher tuition fees

# Warrant

Fig 1.1 is a Tableau bar chart for comparing and contrasting the tuition fees and rankings of different regional universities in California. The yellow color bar charts show that SCU has as higher tuition fees than the other universities. However, the blue line shows the rankings of the schools, and we can see that SCU is a top ranked university at Rank 2. Therefore, a greater benefit of decent ranking of the SCU MSIS program outweight the cost of attending the school. We can also see that San Jose State University is another good pragram as it has a reasonable low tution fees being a public university and its ranking is better as compared to other expensive programs

# Claim

Despite being a top ranked school, Santa Clara University has a higher acceptance rate than many other schools

# Warrant

We can see from Fig 1.2 that SCU has a decent ranking 2 in the group with other universities, and still have a moderately high acceptance rate of 50%. Some of the universities like Cal State - Long Beach has an acceptance rate much lower than their ranking. This might be because of the location feature of the university as in bigger cities like Los Angeles, the population affects the no.of applicants so much so that the university has to deliberately lower the acceptance rate in order to accomodate only a feasible no.of students at the university facility.

 # Claim
 
 Santa Clara University is a top ranked school with a lower student to faculty ratio
 
 # Warrant
 
 The Tableau scatter plot in Fig 1.3 shows the comparison of ranking and student-faculty ratio of the uiniversities used in our assumption. We can analyze from the visual that SCU is a top ranked program at rank 2 and also has a decently lower student-faculty ratio of 11%. This buttefly chart designed in Tableau is very effective and straightforward for the intended audience of prospective MSIS studently to visually compare and contrast SCU MSIS program with the other regional universities.

 We can analyze from the above several visualizations that integrating the metrics in a single Tableau visual is quite effective for the audience to compare and contrast several features of their expected goals. Santa Clara University stands out in all the above visuals and a prospective MSIS student can easily note that difference
